  - e.g., task could be: "Craft Diamond Block" or "Kill Creeper" etc.
      
    - There are 24 tasks coded from which 8 are chosen:  (2 hard tasks, 6 easy tasks per game)

              - Craft Beacon.

- Imposters win by killing all Crewmates.

- Imposters can use an ability every 15 minutes to set the nearest crewmate within 20 blocks to 1 heart and give them blindness for 15 seconds.

    + A message will appear in chat for the imposters after 15 minutes with a button to click.
    + Clicking the button will activate the ability and restart the cooldown timer.

- Imposters know who each other are (and who has just been blinded by the other imposter)

- Holding a lightning rod in your offhand will give everyone the glowing effect (to show colors through walls) this is balanced by giving the user Hunger V.

    + Analogous to cameras/security in Among Us.
    + 50 block radius.

- Completing a task tells the entire lobby who completed it (Imposters can also complete tasks to 'clear themselves').

    + Hover over the task in chat to see which task it was.
    
- Upon being killed, players are put in spectator mode at their place of death and they get a message telling them to mute their mic.

- Player deaths show in chat, **BUT IT DOES NOT SAY WHAT KILLED THEM** ;)

**Setup:**

+ Load up a fresh/existing world. (ensure command blocks are turned on/are allowed)
+ Place a command block anywhere in the world and attach a lever directly to the SIDE (not the top)
+ Get all players to join the server
+ Get the PART 1 command and paste it in the command block.
+ Run the command with the lever. (Something special should happen if you have done it right)
+ Get the PART 2 command and paste it in to the same command block.
+ Run it.
+ Get the PART 3 command and paste it in to the same command block.
+ Run it.

=== SET UP DONE ===

The closest person to the command block when the last command is run will become the HOST. (Make sure it is you)

The host will receive a message in chat which will give them options to Start the game and other options.

- Choose colors by clicking the "Choose Colors" option in chat

- Set the number of Imposters

- Start the game.



Enjoy!

(boys I haven't actually tested it on 1.16 but it it will work with the execption of the lightning rod functionality not existing- if you want to play it on 1.16.1, just paste each part of the command onto a word doc and Cntrl+F the phrase "lightning_rod" and change every instance to any other item you want)
