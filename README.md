! THIS TAKES 20 SECONDS TO SET UP IN A REALM/SERVER (NO MODS/PLUGINS NEEDED)
```

**Mechanics:**

- Up to 10 players

- Choice between having 1 or 2 randomly chosen imposters.

- Choice of 11 different nametag colors.

- Crewmates win by completing all 8 of the randomized Tasks OR killing all imposters.
      - e.g., task could be: "Craft Diamond Block" or "Kill Creeper" etc.

- Imposters win by killing all Crewmates.

- Imposters can use an ability every 15 minutes to set the nearest crewmate within 20 blocks to 1 heart and give them blindness for 15 seconds.

- Imposters know who each other are (and who has just been blinded by the other imposter)

- Holding a lightning rod in your offhand will give everyone the glowing effect (to show colors through walls) this is balanced by giving the user Hunger V.

**Setup:**

Load up a fresh/existing world. (ensure command blocks are turned on/are allowed)
Place a command block anywhere in the world and attach a lever directly to the SIDE (not the top)
Get all players to join the server
Get the PART 1 command and paste it in the command block.
Run the command with the lever. (Something special should happen if you have done it right)
Get the PART 2 command and paste it in to the same command block.
Run it.
Get the PART 3 command and paste it in to the same command block.
Run it.
=== SET UP DONE ===

The closest person to the command block when the last command is run will become the HOST. (Make sure it is you)

The host will receive a message in chat which will give them options to Start the game and other options.

- Choose colors by clicking the "Choose Colors" option in chat

- Set the number of Imposters

- Start the game.



Enjoy!

(boys I haven't actually tested it on 1.16 but it might work with the execption of the lightning rod functionality not existing- if you want to play it on 1.16.1, just paste each part of the command onto a word doc and Cntrl+F the phrase "lightning_rod" and change every instance to any other item you want)
